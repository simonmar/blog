The book was published in August 2013 by O'Reilly Media.

Unfortunately the online copy of the book is temporarily unavailable
as O'Reilly have deprecated the platform that was hosting it.  I hope
to get the content back up in some form in the future, in the meantime
you can find it on <a

## Quotes

This book explains how to write elegant and scalable code
while not shying away from any of the tricky bits and corner cases --
making it an essential companion for any developer!

<div class="quote">
Not only does this book provide an excellent overview of
Haskell as a language for concurrent and parallel programming,
it is essential reading even if you are not a Haskell
programmer. It will change how you think about designing and
building high performance, solid software.

<div class="quote">
These days parallelism and concurrency are ubiquitous, but
parallel and concurrent programs are typically much harder to
write than sequential ones.  Functional programming languages
offer a radical and elegant attack on this challenge, by
tackling the root cause, namely unrestricted side effects.
But would-be users only have the research literature to
guide them.  This is the first book to offer a thorough,
internally-consistent tutorial in parallel and concurrent
functional programming aimed at practitioners rather than
researchers.  Moreover, Simon Marlow knows exactly what he is
talking about: he built GHC's parallel runtime system, and
remains its master.  This book will do more than a hundred
research papers to get parallel functional programming out of
the lab and into the hands of working programmers. Bravo!
